# PyKernel

A Linux kernel that boots into the Python interpreter.

[Buildroot](https://buildroot.org) is used to simplify the build process of a custom Linux kernel for embedded systems.

## Stuff That Needs to be Done â„¢

- [] Download Linux source from kernel.org
- [] Configure a fork to gitlab.pinet.vpn/pykernel/linux and push the code there
- [] Try out buildroot by building and emulating a vanilla kernel (no changes)
- [] Add/modify/remove a driver/module
- [] Change init app (`/sbin/init`) to something else
- [] Fork cpython to gitlab.pinet.vpn/pykernel/cpython
- [] Change main.c for python if needed, reseach what needs to be done first
